General Notes
===============

If you have only one profile in $HOME/.oci then you can directly run the following commands. 
But if there are multiple profiles, then based on which profile you want to use append the following command to it. 

--profile <profile> --config-file $HOME/.oci/config


List All Policy Details in a compartment  

oci iam policy list  --all  \
--compartment-id <comp ocid> 


Get policy details for a particular policy 

oci iam policy get \
--policy-id <policy ocid>
